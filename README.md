## What Your Skill Will Do
The Skill allows users to request a quiz about the 50 States of the USA. They will receive 10 random questions or they can ask for specific information, such as, "tell me about New York".
This simple "quiz" skill will teach you how the different pieces of the Alexa Skill development process fit together.

We use will use the Skill builder UI to build the Skill although the quiz itself does not employ the new "Dialog-Delegate interface" model.
